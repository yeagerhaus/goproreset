# goproreset
Update scripts for manually resetting a GoPro Hero 3's wifi password.  Works with any version of the Hero 3

Instructions:

Format an SD card (MS-DOS/FAT32) using your camera's erase SD card function or your computer's Disk Utility application.  In the "settings.in" file, update the "ssid" and the "password" values to your camera's name and new wifi password respectively.  Drag both files onto your SD card, insert the card into your camera, and power on.  You should see your camera's screen showing an "Updating Wifi Settings" message.

Note that you might need to remove your battery from the camera and insert the SD card without the battery, reinsert the battery, and then power on your camera.
